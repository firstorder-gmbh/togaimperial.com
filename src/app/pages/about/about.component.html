  <h2>The TOGA brand</h2>
  <h4><strong>Mission statement</strong></h4>
  <p>
    We at TOGA believe that fashion, first and foremost, should be something useful and functional. Second, purposeful fashion 
    should not require a supreme effort in deciding what to wear. Clothing should follow the design path of any object we 
    consider to be functional and that supports our way of living. We at TOGA strive to give impulse to a new fashion era, 
    one that addresses the functionality of the notion, but that is at the service of the customer. We see clothing always 
    as functional, modular, the only straight way to improve the overall quality of life. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For all the people who think, dream, create: 
    stop wasting time with choosing a garderobe. Our TOGA garment pieces serve a purpose of extreme functionality. 
    The customers feel that our uniforms make them more important while wearing them. But it also saves them so much time, 
    time that can be reinvested with family, friends, hobbies. Always choose TOGA to preserve your life quality, 
    to destress your morning habits, and to shine differently. And lastly, choose TOGA to keep your true self throughout the 
    day, by only wearing purposeful clothing.
